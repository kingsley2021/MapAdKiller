/**
 * Shim for the 百度-only variant.
 *
 * <p>The 高德 half is not compiled into this build, but this class still has to exist and still
 * has to <b>forward</b>: a single APK declares exactly one Xposed entry point
 * ({@code META-INF/xposed/java_init.list}), so the shared entry reaches every other vendor half
 * by name through this dispatcher.
 *
 * <p><b>Why not a plain no-op.</b> A no-op compiles fine and passes every structural check --
 * and then 百度 gets no hooks at all, because the only path to
 * {@code bmapclean.MainHook.onPackageReady} runs through here. That is precisely how 2.1.4
 * shipped with 百度 silently dead. So this shim keeps the package dispatch and forwards 百度 to
 * its real adapter; only 高德 and 腾讯, which genuinely are not in this build, are dropped.
 *
 * <p>{@code onModuleLoaded} is deliberately empty: {@code mapclean.MainHook} already calls
 * {@code bmapclean.MainHook.onModuleLoaded} directly, so forwarding it here as well would just
 * run the same assignment twice.
