/**
 * Stub for the slim (高德-only) variant.
 *
 * The whole 百度 adapter is dropped from this build, but the shared dispatchers
 * ({@code mapclean.MainHook} for {@code onModuleLoaded}, {@code mapadkiller.MainHook} for
 * {@code onPackageReady}) still forward to it -- a single APK can only declare one Xposed
 * entry point, so the other halves have to be reached by explicit forwarding.
 *
 * <b>This stub is the reason those forwardings can live in shared source.</b> An earlier
 * attempt deleted the calls instead, which compiled the slim build but silently disabled
 * 百度 in the full module: the免 root build never runs 百度, the module does.
